== Instagram HashTag Gallery

This is a simple application built in Ruby on Rails, which displays trending images of a certain hashtag on instagram, in a responsive gallery.  It also supports endless pagination, and displays additional data about each image, such as likes, user profile, and caption.  These can be seen in a (fancybox) modal dialog when each image is clicked.
